## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

### What I learned

The biggest challenge was with the hero images, which behave differently as we open the screen size. Creating a logic to structure this in a way that would be easy to code for all sizes was the icing on the cake.

### Useful resources

- [The 7-1 Pattern](https://www.educative.io/courses/sass-for-css/the-7-1-pattern) - This article helped me a lot to organize my Sass folders.
